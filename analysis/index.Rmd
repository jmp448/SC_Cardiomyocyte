This site contains the workflow for the single cell cardiomyocyte differentiation project.  This project is done in collaboration with Reem Elorbany and the [Gilad lab](https://giladlab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.  The workflow consists of the following parts:

1. [Quality Control](quality_control.html)
  + Quality control of demuxlet data, taking a look at how many nonsense calls are made for each collection

2. [Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Differential Expression Analysis](seurat_diffex.html)
  + To take a look at differential expression analysis using [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/)
  
3. [Pseudotime, Trajectory Analysis](pseudotime.html)
  + Analyze progression through differentiation from iPSC to cardiomyocyte at single-cell resolution using [Monocle](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/docs/introduction/).
