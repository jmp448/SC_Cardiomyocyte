This site contains the workflow for the single cell cardiomyocyte differentiation project.  This project is done in collaboration with Reem Elorbany and the [Gilad lab](https://giladlab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.  The workflow consists of the following parts:

1. Quality Control
  + [Before filtering](quality_control.html)
  + [After filtering](quality_control_doublet_filtered.html) out same-individual doublets
  
2. Dimensionality Reduction
  + [Dimensionality reduction](dim_reduce.html)
  + [Dimensionality reduction](dim_reduce_2.html) after filtering out doublets
  
3. Doublet Analysis
  + [Collection Day 1](doublet_analysis_CD1.html)
  + [Collection Day 2](doublet_analysis_CD2.html)
  + [Collection Day 3](doublet_analysis_CD3.html)
  
4. Quality Control Classifier - labeling data
